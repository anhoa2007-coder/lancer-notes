# lancer-notes
A Markdown notes app that's heavily forked from orginial Lancer Notes.\
With markdown and text editing support\
And easy to use UI, you can use it like other text editors.
#### Importantly...
It's lightweight, only less than 40-60MB of usage, and low depdenacies, it's better than mainstream text editors (beside Notepad even with AI crap)
